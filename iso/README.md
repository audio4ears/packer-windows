### What Is This Directory For?

You should download your Windows Server ISO images from TechNet/MSDN and place them in this folder. We need to do this because MSDN / TechNet are protected by Microsoft (Live) ID, which does not support HTTP basic authentication or the OAuth2 username / password flow.

For example, you might want to start with one of the following:

* Windows Server 2012 (Volume License):
	* File Name: en_windows_server_2012_vl_x64_dvd_917758.iso
	* SHA1 Hash: 063BC26ED45C50D3745CCAD52DD7B3F3CE13F36D
	* Direct Download: http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/json/GetDownloadRequest?brand=MSDN&locale=en-us&fileId=50573&activexDisabled=true&akamaiDL=false
